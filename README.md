Linear SVM has a better accuracy score than Gaussian Naive Bayes with 62.61% compared to 53.49%. One possible explanation for this difference in performance could be attributed to the suitability of Linear Support Vector Machines (SVM) for handling complex and non-linearly separable datasets. SVM aims to maximize the margin between data points and the decision boundary, which enhances its resilience to outliers and non-linear relationships within the data. Moreover, SVM offers flexibility through various kernel functions, enabling it to adapt to different data distributions effectively. Conversely, Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes feature independence, which may limit its effectiveness, particularly in handling complex datasets.

Additionally, the effectiveness of Naive Bayes can be influenced by factors such as dataset size, structure, and the distribution of data. For instance, if the features are not independent as assumed by Naive Bayes, its performance may suffer. Furthermore, suboptimal hyperparameters in Naive Bayes can lead to lower accuracy scores, highlighting the importance of proper parameter tuning. It's crucial to consider various evaluation metrics beyond just accuracy, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, for a comprehensive assessment of model performance.
